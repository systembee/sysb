We can download the compatible ssh client from [GitHub](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases)

One of our user suggested the following:
- Windows 10 I recommend always go with Developer mode so that way you can install the OpenSSH client (beta) feature; and as always the fast ring on Windows 10 Insider Preview 

- On Windows 7 it would mean installing things like cygwin or mingw though and adding them to system path on the bin folder there in order to use ssh on Windows 7 up to before Windows 10
