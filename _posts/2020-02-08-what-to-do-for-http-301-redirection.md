It seems you are getting HTTP 301 status code. We get HTTP 301 redirection if the tunnel is not setup or existing tunnel was broken or terminated.

If you still face this issue while tunneling is active then please let us now at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sysb_ai) or drop us a email at [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sysb_ai)
