It seems you are getting HTTP 301 status code. We get HTTP 301 redirection if the tunnel is not setup or existing tunnel was broken or terminated. We advice you to execute the tunneling command again to establish the connectivity.

If you had supplied [static subdomain]({% post_url 2020-02-04-how-to-get-static-subdomain %}) request then you will have same URL otherwise a next available dynamic URL.

If you still face this issue while tunneling is active then please let us now at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sysb_ai) or drop us a email at [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sysb_ai)
