  - question: My internet speed is very slow and getting frequent disconnection
    answer: >-
      We advice you to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">-C</code> in your ssh client flags as it will compress the data being used in the connection. Though, it will only slow down things on fast networks. So I advice to use only when network is damn slow. Syntax is as follows:
        1. <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh -CR 0:127.0.0.1:8080 demo@sysb.ai</code>
        1. Keep notice on <code class="highlighter-rouge">-C</code> flag

  - question: How to avoid frequent disconnect due to idle timeout?
    answer: >-
      We recommened to put the directives like <code class="highlighter-rouge">ServerAliveInterval</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">ServerAliveCountMax</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/config</code> file which will protect the idle session from getting disconnected

  - question: How do we proniciate sysb.ai?
    answer: >-
      it is 'sisbi dot ai'
